Additionally, it gives an important piece of information that the first docstring doesn't explicitly state: \"If no odd number is found, guarantees that all elements in the array are even.\" This additional information supplements the first docstring's description without contradicting or omitting any part of it.\n\nIn essence, everything from the first docstring is contained within the second docstring, along with additional clarifications. Thus, the second docstring can be seen as a more complete and detailed version of the first, and it contains all the information from the first one."
